# About Me

I’m Jillian Weiss, currently pursuing an MS in Biotechnology with a concentration in Bioinformatics at Johns Hopkins. With a BS in Bioengineering and a passion for financial analysis, I aim to bridge the gap between science and investing. I specialize in evaluating biotech firms, combining technical understanding with equity research tools to generate actionable insights.

I’m especially interested in gene therapies, oncology pipelines, and the role of bioinformatics in precision medicine. Outside of work, I enjoy skiing, winter sports, photography, and following the New York Rangers.
