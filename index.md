# About Me

I recently completed my M.S. in Biotechnology with a concentration in Bioinformatics from Johns Hopkins University, after earning my B.S. in Bioengineering from the University of Maryland. Throughout my academic journey, I developed a strong foundation in molecular biology, computational analysis, and data-driven research, while also gaining exposure to the regulatory, commercial, and strategic elements that shape the biotech industry.

During graduate school, I became especially interested in how scientific innovation translates into real-world solutions—and how business strategy drives that process. This sparked a growing passion for the intersection of science, business, and finance. I’m fascinated by how tools like bioinformatics and genomics can inform R&D decisions, investment strategies, and the broader landscape of personalized medicine and therapeutic development.

I am particularly drawn to roles that allow me to work across disciplines, connect ideas, and contribute to meaningful innovation in healthcare and biotechnology. I’m always eager to learn more, share ideas, and connect with others who are working at this exciting intersection. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat or collaborate!
