    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I recently completed my M.S. in Biotechnology with a concentration in Bioinformatics from Johns Hopkins University, after earning my B.S. in Bioengineering from the University of Maryland. During my graduate studies, I gained a deeper understanding of the business aspects of biotechnology, which sparked a strong interest in exploring career opportunities at the intersection of science, business, and strategy within the biotech industry.
    <p>I am passionate about bioinformatics, genetics, biotech, and the bridge between these fields and finance. I would love to engage in discussions about these areas and explore their intersection. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat!</p>
